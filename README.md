## Summary
This repository stores the code I used for my final project for Professor Mike Brigg's ECE 3 class.


## Setup
[595-TIRSLK-EVM](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/TIRSLK-EVM?qs=B6kkDfuK7%2FDENpSTo9fPvw%3D%3D&mgh=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1ICZBhAzEiwAFfvFhLgqcXgqbegi43C86LxLH64A4QEBmuNMMTXp193QZ1anuiqYVPqoZRoCm5kQAvD_BwE)
and [LP-CC2652R7 CC2652R7 LaunchPad](https://www.mouser.com/new/texas-instruments/ti-lp-cc2652r7-development-kit/), Arduino IDE was used to assemble and program
a path following car. The car uses IR sensors and the code posted in this repository (Fast-ExtraCredit.ino or Slow-Steady.ino) to complete the track which can be found
[here](https://selim-emir-can.github.io/ECE-3-Car.html). The ECE3.zip file needs to be downloaded and added as a library in the Arduino IDE in order for both 
Fast-ExtraCredit.ino or Slow-Steady.ino to compile.
